<h1>The Best movies according to HTE </h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all all-time</h2>

<hr>

<h3> Deadpool</h3>
<p>Obviously because of Ryan Reynolds
    <br>
    <i>Note: This is not a family movie. We have a collection of expletives, violence and ...</i>
</p>

<h3>Captain America Civil War</h3>
<p>I love Iron Man and I love Captain America so the both of them in a movie felt surreal</p>

<h3>Blade</h3>
<p>Who doesnt love a mad gun wielding vampire and as a plus, Reynolds is in the movie</p>
